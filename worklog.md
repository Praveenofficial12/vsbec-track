Work Log:
- Read the full prompt file (Pasted Content_1791190365291.txt) - 2244 lines covering 60 sections
- Analyzed the requirements: comprehensive college placement ERP with student profiles, companies, drives, rounds, analytics, recommendations
- Created comprehensive Prisma schema with models: Student, Company, Drive, Round, DriveParticipation, RoundResult, Certification, Project, Notification, AdminUser, AuditLog, PlacementRule, CustomField
- Ran `bun run db:push` - schema synced successfully
- Prisma Client generated

Stage Summary:
- Database schema is ready with all relationships
- Schema uses CSV-separated strings for skills (SQLite limitation on lists)
- All key indexes created: register_number, department, year, section, placement_status, company_id, drive_id
- Single-page SPA architecture will be used (all on `/` route due to constraints)
- Will use API routes for backend, Prisma + SQLite (instead of Supabase as in original prompt)
